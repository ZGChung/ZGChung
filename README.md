## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am an AI engineer / Data Scientist working at Apple. 

Besides my job, I do:

- Scientific research in LLM, recently focusing on RL and Multi-Agent Systems.
- Full-stack web app dev, implementing and trying my silly or funny ideas.
- Bar exploration, hunting all the niche bars in different cities.

Actively looking for new challenges / opportunities in LLM.
